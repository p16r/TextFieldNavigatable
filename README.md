# TextFieldNavigatable

A protocol with a default implementation that adds a toolbar above the
keyboard with Previous, Next, and Done buttons.

## Usage

Simply make your `UIViewController` subclass conform to 
`TextFieldNavigatable` like so:

```

class ViewController: UIViewController {
	â‹®
}

extension ViewController: TextFieldNavigatable {}

```

## The Protocol

`TextFieldNavigatable` exposes just one method:

```swift

func addToolbar(
    to textFields: UITextField?...,
    isNavigatable: Bool,
    isDismissable: Bool,
    nextButtonText: String,
    previousButtonText: String
)

```

## The Extension

`TextFieldNavigatable` comes with a default implementation that takes an
ordered list of `UITextField`s and adds a toolbar with navigation
buttons to each of them. Tapping Next or Previous will shift the input
focus to the next or previous text field in the argument list.
